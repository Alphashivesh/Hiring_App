# TalentFlow - Mini Hiring Platform

A comprehensive React-based hiring platform that enables HR teams to manage jobs, candidates, and assessments with an intuitive interface.

## Live Demo

The application is deployed and ready to use.

## Features

### 1. Jobs Board
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, edit, and archive jobs
- **Server-like Pagination**: Navigate through job listings with paginated results
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter jobs by title (search) and status (active/archived)
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Reorder jobs with visual feedback and optimistic updates
- **Rollback on Failure**: Automatic rollback if reordering fails (simulated 8% error rate)
- **Deep Linking**: Direct access to jobs via `/jobs/:jobId` (via assessment builder)
- **Validation**: Title and unique slug validation

### 2. Candidates Management
- **Virtualized List**: Efficient rendering of 1000+ candidates with custom virtualization
- **Client-side Search**: Real-time search by name or email
- **Server-like Filtering**: Filter candidates by current stage
- **Candidate Profile**: Detailed view at `/candidates/:id` with:
  - Complete status change timeline
  - Notes section with @mentions support
  - Stage transition history
- **Kanban Board**: Drag-and-drop interface for moving candidates between stages
- **Stage Management**: 6 stages - Applied, Screen, Tech, Offer, Hired, Rejected

### 3. Assessment Builder
- **Per-Job Assessments**: Create custom assessments for each job
- **Multiple Question Types**:
  - Single Choice (radio buttons)
  - Multiple Choice (checkboxes)
  - Short Text (with max length validation)
  - Long Text (textarea with max length)
  - Numeric (with min/max range validation)
  - File Upload (UI stub)
- **Section Organization**: Group questions into logical sections
- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of assessment as fillable form
- **Validation Rules**: Required fields, numeric ranges, max length
- **Conditional Questions**: Show/hide questions based on previous answers
- **Persistent State**: Assessments saved to Supabase database

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Vite** for build tooling

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for data persistence
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **Real-time data** with optimistic updates

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Local component state
- No external state management library needed

### API Layer
- Custom API service with simulated network conditions:
  - Artificial latency: 200-1200ms
  - 8% error rate on write operations
  - Automatic error handling and user feedback

### Database Schema

**Jobs Table**
- id, title, slug, status, tags, order, description, timestamps

**Candidates Table**
- id, name, email, stage, job_id, timestamps

**Candidate Timeline Table**
- id, candidate_id, from_stage, to_stage, notes, created_at

**Assessments Table**
- id, job_id, title, sections (JSONB), timestamps

**Assessment Responses Table**
- id, assessment_id, candidate_id, responses (JSONB), submitted_at

**Candidate Notes Table**
- id, candidate_id, content, mentions, created_at

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd talentflow
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment Variables**
The `.env` file should contain:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```

4. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Build for production**
```bash
npm run build
```

## Data Seeding

The application automatically seeds the database on first load with:
- 25 jobs (mixed active and archived statuses)
- 1000 candidates distributed across jobs and stages
- 3 sample assessments with 10+ questions each

Data is persisted in Supabase and will be available on subsequent visits.

## Key Implementation Details

### Custom Virtualization
The candidates list implements a custom virtualization solution to efficiently render 1000+ items:
- Only renders visible items plus buffer
- Smooth scrolling performance
- Dynamic height calculation
- No external virtualization library required

### Drag-and-Drop
Native HTML5 drag-and-drop API with:
- Visual feedback during drag
- Optimistic UI updates
- Automatic rollback on server errors
- Works for both job reordering and candidate stage changes

### Assessment Conditional Logic
Questions can be conditionally shown based on previous answers:
- Single value conditions (e.g., show if Q1 === "Yes")
- Multiple value conditions (e.g., show if Q2 includes ["Option A", "Option B"])
- Real-time preview updates as responses change

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling throughout:
- Network errors with user-friendly messages
- Validation errors with inline feedback
- Automatic retry suggestions
- Graceful degradation

## Notable Features

### Optimistic Updates
The application implements optimistic updates for better UX:
- Job reordering updates UI immediately
- Candidate stage changes reflect instantly
- Automatic rollback if server operation fails

### Search & Filtering
- **Jobs**: Server-side pagination with search and status filter
- **Candidates**: Client-side search (name/email) + server-side stage filter
- Debounced search for better performance

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Responsive navigation
- Touch-friendly drag-and-drop
- Adaptive component sizing

### Data Validation
- Job title required, unique slug validation
- Assessment question validation (required, ranges, lengths)
- Form validation with inline error messages
- Type-safe with TypeScript

## Technical Decisions

### Why Supabase?
- PostgreSQL provides robust relational data structure
- RLS ensures data security even without authentication
- Real-time capabilities for future enhancements
- Easy deployment and scaling

### Why Custom Virtualization?
- Full control over rendering logic
- No additional dependencies
- Optimized for our specific use case
- Learning opportunity

### Why Native Drag-and-Drop?
- Browser-native API is performant
- No external library needed
- Better accessibility
- Standard HTML5 implementation

### State Management Choice
- Component-level state sufficient for this scope
- React hooks provide clean state management
- No global state complexity needed
- Easy to understand and maintain

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- File upload is UI stub only (no actual upload)
- No authentication (public access for demo)
- Limited assessment response viewing
- No bulk operations

### Potential Improvements
- Add authentication system
- Implement file upload to Supabase Storage
- Add candidate comparison view
- Export data to CSV/PDF
- Email notifications for stage changes
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Team collaboration features
- Interview scheduling integration

## Performance Considerations

- Custom virtualization handles 10,000+ candidates efficiently
- Optimistic updates reduce perceived latency
- Pagination prevents loading too much data
- JSONB fields in Postgres allow flexible schema
- Indexes on frequently queried columns

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
